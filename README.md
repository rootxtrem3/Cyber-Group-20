# ThreatView: A Modern, Containerized Honeypot Dashboard

**ThreatView** is an all-in-one solution for deploying a comprehensive IoT honeypot environment with a modern, real-time web dashboard.  
This project is generated by a single shell script that uses Docker Compose to set up a multi-container environment for monitoring and analyzing malicious network traffic in a secure and isolated way.

## 🔍 What is this project?

ThreatView is a **fully automated honeypot deployment and visualization system**.  
It launches several honeypots that mimic vulnerable IoT services frequently targeted by attackers. All captured activity is processed and displayed through a sleek, real-time dashboard.

The entire stack — from honeypots to log processors and the web UI — is defined and orchestrated via **Docker**, ensuring portability, scalability, and easy setup or teardown.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🕵️‍♂️ Multi-Honeypot Environment
Deploys multiple honeypots to capture diverse attack vectors:

- **Cowrie** — A medium-interaction SSH/Telnet honeypot capturing brute-force attempts and shell interactions.  
- **Dionaea** — A low-interaction honeypot designed to trap malware by emulating SMB, FTP, HTTP, MSSQL, and more.

### 📊 Real-time Dashboard
A minimal, neon-themed web dashboard displays:
- Live attack events on a map  
- Real-time logs and statistics  
- Summaries of attackers, ports, and malware activity  

### ⚙️ Backend & Log Enrichment
A dedicated **Node.js backend**:
- Receives honeypot events  
- Enriches them with **GeoIP** data (country, city, coordinates)  
- Stores all activity in a **persistent SQLite** database  
- Pushes **live updates** to the frontend via **WebSockets**  

### 🔄 Flexible Log Pipeline
Two modes of operation:
1. **Filebeat → Logstash** pipeline for enterprise-grade log parsing and forwarding.  
2. **Direct-watch mode** where the backend monitors honeypot logs directly.

### 🧩 Containerized & Isolated
All services run within **Docker containers**, ensuring complete isolation from the host and clean lifecycle management.

### ⚡ Single-Script Deployment
A single **bash script** generates the entire infrastructure:
- Frontend and backend setup  
- Docker Compose configuration  
- Utility and data directories

## 💡 What Problem Does It Solve?

Deploying and managing multiple honeypots manually can be tedious — requiring multiple tools, configs, and data pipelines.  
ThreatView streamlines the process by:

- **Automating setup** with one command.  
- **Centralizing monitoring** across all honeypots.  
- **Providing safe, isolated learning environments** for cybersecurity professionals and students.

This makes it an ideal platform for research, teaching, and real-time threat analysis without endangering real systems.
